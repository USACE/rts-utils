# RTS Data Acquisition Utilities

> **NOTICE:** _script_downloader has been replaced by a new process. See the **[Wiki](https://github.com/USACE/rts-utils/wiki)** for details._

> `rtsutils` has been refactored to act more like an installed Python package within the CAVI virtual environment. Code that once added `rtsutils` to the `PYTHONPATH`, within each script, has been removed and CAVI configurations modified by the installer placing the package in the `PYTHONPATH`. This allows for traditional `import` statements accessing `rtsutils` modules. A single `include` statement will be added to the CWMS installation CAVI configuration file (HEC-RTS.config for RTS) during the installation process.
